    ('Sendero Balcones',
     2.8,
     'Sacramento, CA',
     'Stretching across Government Canyon''s backcountry, Sendero Balcones cuts a path along the top of the Balcones Escarpment. This rough, rock-strewn trail requires constant attention to pathfinding and can be very mentally tiring.
The track splits off from Recharge Trail at a signed map and a trail marker just east of Bluff Spurs. It is a rocky, moderately technical singletrack, at times widening to doubletrack. The rocks come in varying sizes. While they don''t require any climbing, they often create hazardous footing throughout Sendero Balcones'' four-plus miles, and therein lies most of the challenge of this route. It requires an eyes-down approach to hiking and a slower pace than other area trails. On the up side, nearly the entire trail is covered by tree canopy, providing plenty of shade from the scorching Texas sun.
The path makes a steady, low-grade climb up to the top of one of the Balcones'' many hills over its first mile. The second entry to Bluff Spurs is found about a half mile in, at another map/marker intersection. From here, it''s a remote-feeling mile and a half to the next intersection, with a few brief smooth segments breaking up the constant rock hopping and dodging. Thanks to the thick tree cover, the view doesn''t change much, but the plant life makes the air fragrant and cool.'),
    ('Black Hill Loop',
     4.3,
    'Somewhere, USA',
     'The longest trail in Government Canyon, secluded Black Hill Loop circles the Protected Habitat Area. The northern end starts at a large gate close to where Sendero Balcones turns west. Singletrack and considerably smoother, at least at the beginning, the route heads off to the northeast on a mostly flat course. Some grass overgrowth helps cushion the path even further, making it a welcome break from the rocky trails that connect to it.
A greater variety of plant life is present along Black Hill Loop. Look for different types of cacti and some very large sotol plants. Black Hill is also much more open to the sky, with some nice large clearings to break up the forested sections. A few rocky sections add some changes, but they are not technical, making for an easy and fast first two miles.
At the mile and a half point, where the path turns back towards the trailhead, there is a huge cactus field to the left of the trail. Cave Creek Trail is at the southern end of a large clearing just after this section. There are only brown markers to show where the trail splits off, so keep an eye out for a dirt singletrack branching to the right.
As Black Hill nears the two-mile point, a neighborhood is visible to the left. Not long after, the trail begins a quick descent followed by a half-mile climb, twisting frequently as it goes. The route is much more challenging through these sections, requiring some careful footwork to pick a clean line through the rocks which have started to appear. The more technical character of the trail will continue until the end, also throwing in some roots growing across the path which can catch an unsuspecting hiker''s foot.'),
    ('Twin Oaks Trail',
     3.0,
    'San Antonio, TX',
     'The Twin Oaks Trail begins a little after reaching the two mile point on Joe Johnston Route. Look for the bench/trail map/marker combination present at most of the park''s major intersections. The path begins as a fairly wide singletrack, taking a frequently winding path through tree canopy. The live oaks that give this trail its name are a staple of the Texas Hill Country, and they provide ample shade from the sun throughout the route.
As Twin Oaks climbs, it becomes a little more technical than the Joe Johnston Route. Smooth and rocky sections alternate, and while there are a few tricky areas requiring some pathfinding through debris, they are usually short and not very troublesome. Users familiar with other Hill Country routes will find Twin Oaks to be familiar territory; this is a "stereotypical" central Texas trail.
Around a mile and a quarter in, the path passes its namesake twin oaks, seen off the trail to the right. A bench facing the trees here provides a rest opportunity. Continue onward to the northeast. The next three quarters of a mile is fairly flat and easy to manage.
Twin Oaks crosses Sendero Balcones just after the two mile mark. A large sign is posted at the intersection. The remaining portion, a little over a half mile in length, is within the Protected Habitat Area and is the southernmost entry point. This region of the State Natural Area is restricted to pedestrians only and is open from September to February. A wooden barrier will be placed across the singletrack during closures.
The final portion is a counterclockwise circle, with a slow climb up and back down to the finish. The tree canopy opens up a few times along the way. The increased sunlight encourages grass growth, which can obscure underlying rocks at times, so use caution. Twin Oaks ends at Black Hill Loop. From here, hikers can turn right to visit the furthest reaches of the park, or left to return to Sendero Balcones.'),

     'Nice little trail. Narrow in some areas. Clearly marked though.

     'Dallas, TX',
     'Nice little trail. Narrow in some areas. Clearly marked though.
     You''ll see the marker for Bear Grass at the top of the Red Oak trail. It goes off the pavement into natural terrain. Steep in areas and muddy after rain.'),
    ('Apache Creek Greenway Trail',
     3.5,
    'Houston, TX',
     'Apache Creek Greenway is a 12.3 mile out and back trail located near San Antonio, Texas. The trail is rated as moderate and offers a number of activity options.'),
    ('Medina River Greenway Trail',
     4.4,
    'Austin, TX',
     'This is a nice long greenway trail that starts at the golf course and has a varied terrain - lakes, fields, and the river.
Accessibility: There are 2 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of Clubhouse Boulevard at the east end of the trail. Both of them are van-accessible with a striped access aisle. The trail surface is cement, smooth, and typically at least 6 feet wide. The most accessible portion of the trail is the first 3.5 miles out. The estimated grade is mostly gentle (5% or less) except for very steep (over 12%) uphill and downhill sections at about 4.0 through 12.0 miles when going west.  Wheelchair/mobility equipment or stroller users may need assistance in the steeper sections or to avoid them for safety. There are benches along the route for resting.');
