     'Stretching across Government Canyon''s backcountry, Sendero Balcones cuts a path along the top of the Balcones Escarpment. This rough, rock-strewn trail requires constant attention to pathfinding and can be very mentally tiring.
The track splits off from Recharge Trail at a signed map and a trail marker just east of Bluff Spurs. It is a rocky, moderately technical singletrack, at times widening to doubletrack. The rocks come in varying sizes. While they don''t require any climbing, they often create hazardous footing throughout Sendero Balcones'' four-plus miles, and therein lies most of the challenge of this route. It requires an eyes-down approach to hiking and a slower pace than other area trails. On the up side, nearly the entire trail is covered by tree canopy, providing plenty of shade from the scorching Texas sun.
The path makes a steady, low-grade climb up to the top of one of the Balcones'' many hills over its first mile. The second entry to Bluff Spurs is found about a half mile in, at another map/marker intersection. From here, it''s a remote-feeling mile and a half to the next intersection, with a few brief smooth segments breaking up the constant rock hopping and dodging. Thanks to the thick tree cover, the view doesn''t change much, but the plant life makes the air fragrant and cool.'),

     'The longest trail in Government Canyon, secluded Black Hill Loop circles the Protected Habitat Area. The northern end starts at a large gate close to where Sendero Balcones turns west. Singletrack and considerably smoother, at least at the beginning, the route heads off to the northeast on a mostly flat course. Some grass overgrowth helps cushion the path even further, making it a welcome break from the rocky trails that connect to it.
A greater variety of plant life is present along Black Hill Loop. Look for different types of cacti and some very large sotol plants. Black Hill is also much more open to the sky, with some nice large clearings to break up the forested sections. A few rocky sections add some changes, but they are not technical, making for an easy and fast first two miles.
At the mile and a half point, where the path turns back towards the trailhead, there is a huge cactus field to the left of the trail. Cave Creek Trail is at the southern end of a large clearing just after this section. There are only brown markers to show where the trail splits off, so keep an eye out for a dirt singletrack branching to the right.
As Black Hill nears the two-mile point, a neighborhood is visible to the left. Not long after, the trail begins a quick descent followed by a half-mile climb, twisting frequently as it goes. The route is much more challenging through these sections, requiring some careful footwork to pick a clean line through the rocks which have started to appear. The more technical character of the trail will continue until the end, also throwing in some roots growing across the path which can catch an unsuspecting hiker''s foot.'),

     'The Twin Oaks Trail begins a little after reaching the two mile point on Joe Johnston Route. Look for the bench/trail map/marker combination present at most of the park''s major intersections. The path begins as a fairly wide singletrack, taking a frequently winding path through tree canopy. The live oaks that give this trail its name are a staple of the Texas Hill Country, and they provide ample shade from the sun throughout the route.
As Twin Oaks climbs, it becomes a little more technical than the Joe Johnston Route. Smooth and rocky sections alternate, and while there are a few tricky areas requiring some pathfinding through debris, they are usually short and not very troublesome. Users familiar with other Hill Country routes will find Twin Oaks to be familiar territory; this is a "stereotypical" central Texas trail.
Around a mile and a quarter in, the path passes its namesake twin oaks, seen off the trail to the right. A bench facing the trees here provides a rest opportunity. Continue onward to the northeast. The next three quarters of a mile is fairly flat and easy to manage.
Twin Oaks crosses Sendero Balcones just after the two mile mark. A large sign is posted at the intersection. The remaining portion, a little over a half mile in length, is within the Protected Habitat Area and is the southernmost entry point. This region of the State Natural Area is restricted to pedestrians only and is open from September to February. A wooden barrier will be placed across the singletrack during closures.
The final portion is a counterclockwise circle, with a slow climb up and back down to the finish. The tree canopy opens up a few times along the way. The increased sunlight encourages grass growth, which can obscure underlying rocks at times, so use caution. Twin Oaks ends at Black Hill Loop. From here, hikers can turn right to visit the furthest reaches of the park, or left to return to Sendero Balcones.'),

     'Salado Creek Greenway offers 19 miles of paved trail along San Antonio''s east side. Although the trail is still under development, its three completed segments (listed below, north to south) offer connections to many parks and neighborhoods.
Segment 1: Huebner Road to West Avenue
This northernmost segment is about 5 miles long and one of the trail''s most scenic. The pathway traces the Salado Creek through bluffs and hardwood forest. A highlight of the route is Voelcker farmstead, an archaeological site and historic set of buildings situated in Phil Hardberger Park. Named after a former San Antonio mayor, the park is an urban green oasis with native grasses and heritage oaks.
The trail continues to another worthwhile attraction, Walker Ranch Historic Landmark Park, which offers beautiful natural landscapes, picnic areas, a large pavilion, restrooms, and a playground.
To continue east on the greenway, passing Walker Ranch Park, take a left at the fork as you approach the park. This will keep you on the northern edge of the historical park. There will be another fork as you approach the main parking area of Walker Ranch. Again, stay to the left at the fork. This will keep you on the Salado Creek Greenway and take you under West Avenue and across North Loop Road to the temporary end (as of Sept. 2014) of this segment at US Highway 281.
Segment 2: McAllister Park to James Park
This middle segment is about 6.5 miles long. Its northern end offers a hilltop view of the city skyline and airport. The path traverses over a scenic wetland area with the Morningstar Boardwalk, named in memory of Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Morningstar, and continues through dense woodlands.
About two miles south of McAllister Park, a spur will take you to Lady Bird Johnson Park, a community favorite with a swimming pool, skate park, softball and soccer fields, and basketball courts. Farther south the trails runs through Los Patios, a shopping and dining area, before heading under Loop 410.
On the other side of the busy roadway, the pathway offers a well-shaded retreat under towering pecan and oak trees as it winds through Robert L.B. Tobin Park. The park is a terrific spot for bird-watchers; you may see warblers, buntings, hawks, owls, and many other types of birds. It also offers unique faux bois art in its signage, picnic tables, and benches. The trail ends at John James Park, named for a surveyor who helped establish the city''s boundaries in 1846. The park offers athletic fields, a playground, and restrooms.
Segment 3: Jack White Park to South Side Lions Park
Stretching about 7.5 miles, this is the trail’s longest and southernmost section. It begins in Jack White Park on the north side of I-35 and winds south through Pletz County Park, Martin Luther King Park, Comanche Park, and South Side Lions Park, offering the traveler many amenities and picturesque views of the forest and creek.'),

     'This trail is also called San Antoino Mission Trail guiding people from each of the missions in San Antonio.
     The word mission usually connotes religion. It''s true that San Antonio''s missions revolved around religion and faith, but it doesn''t describe the importance or full scope for any of them. Though intentionally created to spread the Catholic faith, missions are not churches. The church is merely one building among several in any mission. Each complex served as a separate, unique community.
All four churches (Mission Concepcin''s, Mission San Jose''s, Mission San Juan Capistrano''s, and Mission Espada''s) have active Catholic congregations. Though the congregations haven''t been continuously active since the 1700s, many of today''s members are direct descendants of the Indians who built the churches.
In addition to the families, the missions served as the foundation for much of what you’’ll see in Texas today. The architecture, food, culture, textiles, and more all began in the missions in one way or another. Each is different and several served as important sites during the Texas Revolution.
When you visit the missions, be careful. These are historic structures and the masonry may not be able to hold your weight (such as if you decide to try and walk atop a retaining wall). Also, some structures may not be accessible due to restoration work or otherwise.'),
